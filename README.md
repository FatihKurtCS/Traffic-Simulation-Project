# Traffic Simulation Project

## Project Goals
This project aims to develop an agent-based traffic simulation model, designed to analyze and understand urban traffic flow dynamics and improve traffic management strategies.

## Simulation Plan
The simulation includes the following components:
- **Vehicle**: Represents cars with properties like position, speed, and state.
- **TrafficSignal**: Manages traffic flow at intersections, directing vehicles based on signal states.
- **Road**: Serves as the pathway for vehicles, defining lanes and connections.
- **Intersection**: Connects roads, regulating vehicle movement through TrafficSignal interactions.
- **Environment**: Contains all components, coordinating their interactions within the simulation.

## Documentation
- **Literature Review**: Found in `docs/Literature_Review.pdf`, summarizing traffic simulation models.
- **UML Diagram**: Located in `docs/UML_Diagram.png`, depicting component interactions.
- **Planned Tests**: Test cases are outlined in `tests/` for verifying functionality.

## How to Run
Instructions for running the simulation will be added as the project develops.

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements include emergency vehicle prioritization, pedestrian crossings, and variable traffic signal timings.
